                Well where do I start ? She is the most amazing , most gorgeous and most beautiful girl in the whole

                The charmness in her face charms me up and the calmness in her voice calms me down. <br> <br>
                She is like an Angel who flew from sky <br> <br>
                Swirling her wand she can make anyone fall for her eye <span class="red">♥</span>

                Well trust me , she steals heart.<br>
                She makes these amazing reels , as such a person who hated these things now keeps on waiting for her reel to roll out so that he can have a Glimpse of her. <br> <br>
                She works as a pharmacist , and precribes medicines for other but what about me who has fallen so hard for you? <br> <br>
                Also yeah she prepares amazing food ( she says so) . I am eager to taste it and judge it myself though :P<span class="red">♥</span>

                Okay I think we moved to same locality back then around same time.<br>
                I dont remember when i saw her for the first time but yeah she was pretty I knew for sure. <br> 
                She looked innocent somehow and a soul so pure. <br> <br>
                I wanted to talk to her but introvert me back then could not utter a wword <span class="red">♥</span>
                <br>
                But somehow God has managed to listen to me. It feels like we are destined to be together and i feel so blessed.

                Well this has a long answer.<br>
                Knowing her as a friend was okay but knowing her as a lover has changed me so much. <br> <br>
                Its hard to believe but I have felt so much for her in these few days that it feels like a atytachment thats been there for a long while without us knowing. <br>
                The day i dont listen to her voice , makes me miserable<span class="red">♥</span>
                I have never missed someone the way I miss her , yes i have been in love before but never so obsessed. <span class="red">♥</span>
